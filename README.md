# Supply-Demand Analysis using Plotly
Overview

This project aims to analyze supply and demand trends using Python's Plotly library for data visualization. Supply and demand analysis is critical in understanding market dynamics, setting prices, and optimizing resources. Plotly's interactive visualizations provide an intuitive and informative way to explore these concepts.
Features

    Data Visualization: Interactive plots for supply and demand curves.
    Comparative Analysis: Visual comparison between different time periods or markets.
    Trend Identification: Identify trends, peaks, and troughs in supply and demand data.
    User-Friendly Interface: Easily customizable plots with hover information and zoom capabilities.

Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.x
    Plotly (pip install plotly)
    Pandas (pip install pandas)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/mujadil/supply-demand-analysis.git
cd supply-demand-analysis

Install dependencies:


    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Data Preparation:
        Place your supply and demand data in a CSV file within the data/ directory. The file should have columns like date, supply, demand, price, etc.

    Run the Analysis:
        Modify the supply demand.py file to point to your data file.
        Run the script:

        python supply demand.py

    View Results:
        The script will generate an interactive Plotly chart, which will open in your web browser.
        You can zoom, pan, and hover over the chart to see detailed data.

Customization

    Chart Types: Modify the chart type by changing the plotly functions in the analysis.py script (e.g., px.line, px.bar).
    Themes and Layouts: Customize the appearance by adjusting the layout and themes in the Plotly configuration.

Examples

Here are some examples of the types of analysis you can perform:

    Supply vs. Demand over Time:

    python

fig = px.line(df, x='date', y=['supply', 'demand'], title='Supply and Demand Over Time')
fig.show()

Price Impact on Demand:

python

    fig = px.scatter(df, x='price', y='demand', title='Price vs. Demand', trendline='ols')
    fig.show()
